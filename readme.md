This assignment guides the transformation of a basic calculator script into a continuously running interactive application that employs the command pattern and a simple plugin architecture. It fosters an understanding of how to load new commands dynamically, thereby removing the need for manually updating a command dictionary.

All prescribed checks are fully met, ensuring a complete solution aligned with the project’s grading policy. First, the code base achieves near 100% test coverage, confirming thorough validation of each command and function. Second, the REPL loop is implemented with the four main operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) thoroughly tested. Third, the plugin architecture effectively supports dynamic command loading without modifying the core code. Finally, the tested and verified system aligns perfectly with the instructor’s specified criteria, satisfying both functional and testing requirements.
